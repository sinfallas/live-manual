"Live system configuration options are divided into build-time options which "
"are options that are applied at build time and boot-time options which are "
"applied at boot time. Boot-time options are further divided into those "
"occurring early in the boot, applied by the live-boot package, and those "
"that happen later in the boot, applied by live-config. Any boot-time option "
"may be modified by the user by specifying it at the boot prompt. The image "
"may also be built with default boot parameters so users can normally just "
"boot directly to the live system without specifying any options when all of "
"the defaults are suitable. In particular, the argument to #{lb --bootappend-"
"live}# consists of any default kernel command line options for the Live "
"system, such as persistence, keyboard layouts, or timezone. See {Customizing "
"locale and language}#customizing-locale-and-language, for example."

"Build-time configuration options are described in the #{lb config}# man "

"live-config. Although the live-boot and live-config packages are installed "
"within the live system you are building, it is recommended that you also "
"install them on your build system for easy reference when you are working on "
"your configuration. It is safe to do so, as none of the scripts contained "
"within them are executed unless the system is configured as a live system."

"The build process is divided into stages, with various customizations "
"applied in sequence in each. The first stage to run is the *{bootstrap}* "
"stage. This is the initial phase of populating the chroot directory with "
"packages to make a barebones Debian system. This is followed by the *{chroot}"
"* stage, which completes the construction of chroot directory, populating it "
"with all of the packages listed in the configuration, along with any other "
"materials. Most customization of content occurs in this stage. The final "
"stage of preparing the live image is the *{binary}* stage, which builds a "
"bootable image, using the contents of the chroot directory to construct the "
"root filesystem for the Live system, and including the installer and any "
"other additional material on the target medium outside of the Live system's "
"filesystem. After the live image is built, if enabled, the source tarball is "
"built in the *{source}* stage."

"Within each of these stages, there is a particular sequence in which "
"commands are applied. These are arranged in such a way as to ensure "
"customizations can be layered in a reasonable fashion. For example, within "
"the *{chroot}* stage, preseeds are applied before any packages are "
"installed, packages are installed before any locally included files are "
"copied, and hooks are run later, after all of the materials are in place."

"Although #{lb config}# creates a skeletal configuration in the #{config/}# "

"stored in the configuration, they may be copied into the live system's "
"filesystem or into the binary image filesystem, or may provide build-time "
"configurations of the system that would be cumbersome to pass as command-"
"line options. You may include things such as custom lists of packages, "
"custom artwork, or hook scripts to run either at build time or at boot time, "
"boosting the already considerable flexibility of debian-live with code of "
"your own."
