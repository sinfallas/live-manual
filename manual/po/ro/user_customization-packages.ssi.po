"number of options give some control over /{apt}/, or if you prefer, /"

"the case where you do not want a package that is recommended by another "
"package. Suppose you are building an LXDE image using #{task-lxde-desktop}# "
"in #{config/package-lists/desktop.list.chroot}#, but don't want the user "
"prompted to store wifi passwords in the keyring. This metapackage depends "
"on /{lxde-core}/, which recommends /{gksu}/, which in turn recommends /"
"{gnome-keyring}/. So you want to omit the recommended /{gnome-keyring}/ "
"package. This can be done by adding the following stanza to #{config/apt/"
