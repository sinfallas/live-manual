1~procedures Procedures

This chapter documents the procedures within the ${project} for various
tasks that need cooperation with other teams in Debian.

2~ Major Releases

Releasing a new stable major version of Debian includes a lot of different
teams working together to make it happen. At some point, the Live team comes
in and builds live system images. The requirements to do this are:

_* A mirror containing the released versions for the debian and
debian-security archives which the debian-live buildd can access.

_* The names of the image need to be known
(e.g. debian-live-VERSION-ARCH-FLAVOUR.iso).

_* The data from debian-cd needs to be synced (udeb exclude lists).

_* Images are built and mirrored on cdimage.debian.org.

2~ Point Releases

_* Again, we need updated mirrors of debian and debian-security.

_* Images are built and mirrored on cdimage.debian.org.

_* Send announcement mail.

3~ Last Point Release of a Debian Release

Remember to adjust both chroot and binary mirrors when building the last set
of images for a Debian release after it has been moved away from
ftp.debian.org to archive.debian.org. That way, old prebuilt live images are
still useful without user modifications.

3~ Point release announcement template

An announcement mail for point releases can be generated using the template
below and the following command:

code{

 $ sed \
     -e 's|@MAJOR@|9.0|g' \
     -e 's|@MINOR@|9.0.1|g' \
     -e 's|@CODENAME@|stretch|g' \
     -e 's|@ANNOUNCE@|2017/msgXXXXX.html|g'

}code

Please check the mail carefully before sending and pass it to others for
proof-reading.
